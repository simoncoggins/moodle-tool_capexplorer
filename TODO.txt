OLD MENU TODO:
Make "Front page course" category, which:
- switches course menu to show "Front page course" only when selected
  - use categoryid = -1 in getcourses as we do now?
- only appears in category menu if category level NOT selected
- disappears from category menu if category level selected
  - add getcategories.php and populate based on contextlevel=X parameter?
