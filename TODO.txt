MENU TODO:
- Make some nodes not selectable
- Make 'no courses found' not expandable
- Change icons/styles to match type
- Improve messages when no items
- Improve error handling
- More refactoring to simplify/reduce duplication
- Move into dialog with link to select?
- A-Z sub-folders for large numbers

GENERAL TODO:

Expand and select menu on page load if $data->contextid set.
Figure out why some blocks inside a course only have system as parent context.
  Need to change getblocks.php to accept a parentcontextid and return only direct child blocks.
  Need to include blocks folder in other contexts than course (system, frontpage course, category).
  Might want to selectively show Blocks folder depending on if there are any or not (same for modules folder?).
Remove 'change' link for user with no access to user policy link.
Warning if user checks a capability in an invalid context.
Replace as much of styles.css with existing LESS colours as possible.
Fix unit tests - instead of random, have some predefined data and expected results.
More unit tests for functions in locallib.php (e.g. add automatic assignments to tests).
